# Adding or Improving a StealthPDF Translation

## File format

Each language is a single XAML `ResourceDictionary` file in this folder. The filename must be the BCP 47 language tag for the locale:

- `en-US.xaml` - English (US)
- `bn.xaml` - Bengali
- `zh-CN.xaml` - Simplified Chinese
- `zh-TW.xaml` - Traditional Chinese
- `de-DE.xaml` - German
- `es.xaml` - Spanish
- `fr-FR.xaml` - French
- `tr-TR.xaml` - Turkish

## How to contribute

### Editing an existing translation

1. Open the file for your language in GitHub (e.g. `Strings/zh-TW.xaml`)
2. Click the pencil icon to edit
3. Translate the text between the tags - **do not change the `x:Key` values**
4. Click "Commit changes" and open a pull request

### Adding a new language

1. Copy `en-US.xaml` and rename it to the BCP 47 tag for your language
2. Translate the values - leave the `x:Key` attributes untouched. You don't have to do all of them: any key you leave out (or delete) automatically falls back to the English text, so a partial translation is fine and can be filled in over time.
3. Open a pull request with the new file. New languages also need the maintainer to wire them into the app (the language picker and loader), so mention in your PR that it's a new locale.

## Rules

- **Never change `x:Key` values.** The app looks these up by key at runtime.
- **Keep format placeholders intact.** Some strings contain `{0}`, `{1}`, etc. - these are filled in by the app at runtime and must stay in the translation, in the same order.
- **Keep XML entities.** `&amp;` means `&`, `&#xE711;` is a glyph code - leave them as-is.
- **Missing keys fall back to English.** Every language file is layered over `en-US.xaml`, so any key you don't include just shows the English text. You never have to keep a file fully in sync with new keys - translate what you can, and untranslated bits stay readable in English.
- **Use plain hyphens (`-`), not em or en dashes (`—`, `–`),** to match the existing files - unless your language's typography genuinely requires otherwise.
- The file must be valid XML. You can check by pasting it into [xmllint.com](https://www.xmllint.com) or any XML validator.

## Format string example

```xml
<!-- English -->
<sys:String x:Key="Str_Opened">Opened {0} - {1} page(s)</sys:String>

<!-- Spanish -->
<sys:String x:Key="Str_Opened">Abierto {0} - {1} página(s)</sys:String>
```

`{0}` will be replaced with the filename and `{1}` with the page count. The placeholders must stay in the translation.

## Testing your translation

If you want to see your strings in the app before submitting, build from source and change the language in Settings. Otherwise, submit the PR and the maintainer will test it.
